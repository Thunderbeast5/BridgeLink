Build BridgeLink ‚Äì Phase 1 using React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, and Firebase (Auth + Firestore + Functions + Hosting).

Requirements:
	‚Ä¢	Dark, modern UI inspired by ecell.in/nec with a video carousel hero like the GoDaddy India homepage.
	‚Ä¢	Three entities:
	1.	Admin (branch teacher) ‚Üí can view Students & Alumni of their branch, filter by batch year.
	2.	Alumni (pass-outs) ‚Üí sign up, view Students of their branch.
	3.	Students (current) ‚Üí sign up, view Alumni of their branch.
	‚Ä¢	Unified signup (Student/Alumni) with fields: first/middle/last name, college email, role, branch, batch year, password.
	‚Ä¢	Email verification + college email domain enforcement.
	‚Ä¢	Role-based dashboard:
	‚Ä¢	Admin: Stats cards (counts by branch/year), directories of Students/Alumni with filters & search.
	‚Ä¢	Alumni: Student directory (branch-scoped).
	‚Ä¢	Student: Alumni directory (branch-scoped).
	‚Ä¢	Hybrid Firestore Data Model (segregated but consistent):‚Ä®/users/{uid} {
  role, branch, batchYear, names, email, timestamps
}

/branches/{branch}/students/{uid}
/branches/{branch}/alumni/{uid}
/branches/{branch}/admins/{uid}

/metrics/branchYear/{branch}_{year} {
  studentCount, alumniCount
}‚Ä®‚Ä¢	/users ‚Üí master collection (for auth, cross-role search).
	‚Ä¢	/branches/... ‚Üí segregated subcollections for branch-level filtering.
	‚Ä¢	Cloud Functions keep /users and /branches/... in sync.

	‚Ä¢	Security:
	‚Ä¢	Custom claims: { role, branch }.
	‚Ä¢	Admins: read all users in their branch.
	‚Ä¢	Students/Alumni: read opposite role in their branch (public fields only).
	‚Ä¢	Users can only update their own doc.
	‚Ä¢	Features to include: branch/year filters, search bar, dark/light theme toggle, responsive layout, skeleton loaders.
	‚Ä¢	Cloud Functions:
	1.	createUserProfile ‚Üí validates email domain, writes /users/{uid} + /branches/{branch}/{role}/{uid}.
	2.	setAdminClaims ‚Üí sets custom claims, mirrors admin doc.
	3.	onUserWrite ‚Üí updates /metrics/branchYear.
	‚Ä¢	Firestore composite indexes for (role, branch), (role, branch, batchYear), (branch, batchYear), and (role, fullNameLower).
	‚Ä¢	Pages: Landing (video carousel), Login, Signup (unified with role toggle), Verify Email, Dashboards (Admin/Alumni/Student).
	‚Ä¢	Deployable to Firebase Hosting with full Firestore rules + indexes JSON.

Acceptance Criteria:
	‚Ä¢	Unified signup works with role segregation.
	‚Ä¢	Email verification enforced.
	‚Ä¢	Admin sees branch-locked dashboard with segregated student/alumni data.
	‚Ä¢	Alumni sees student directory for their branch.
	‚Ä¢	Students see alumni directory for their branch.
	‚Ä¢	Dark responsive UI with autoplay video carousel landing page.
	‚Ä¢	Firestore rules enforce branch/role access.
	‚Ä¢	Data exists in both /users and branch-level subcollections (hybrid model).

‚∏ª‚Ä®‚Ä®the above is the phase implementation a d below are the features sonnet of them are already in phase 1 and rest will be implemented in next phases so just implement phase 1 and you can add the pages for rest features whose functionality will be done in next phase ‚Ä®also keep the folders separate or each entity

‚ö° This way your system is future-proof:
	‚Ä¢	/users ‚Üí global queries, authentication consistency.
	‚Ä¢	/branches/... ‚Üí fast segregated queries for dashboards.‚Ä®‚Ä®üéì Alumni Features
